# U-Prep-Pathways-Platform
This repository holds NiJeL's work with the University Preparatory Academy in Detroit, MI on the U Prep Pathways Platform

## Getting Started
To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/NiJeLorg/U-Prep-Pathways-Platform.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd electron-markdownify

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start

# On development environment start the app by running gulp, for build process purposes

```

Note: I'd also suggest having Gulp and Sequelize-CLI installed globally, i.e `npm i -g gulp sequelize-cli`
